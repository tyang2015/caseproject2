# Retail Recommender - Groceries

This is a grocery recommendation system that uses item based collaborative filtering and Jaccard similarity matrix to optimize predictions about a consumer's preferences. It is efficient and dynamic in usage, as it can be applied in almost any retail scenario with minor modifications. Recommendations are outputed with their similarity ratings, and can be tailored towards any customer, old and new.
This area is one I am extremely passionate about and hope to gain more experience in building more complex recommendation systems.
Feel free to utilize at your leisure!
